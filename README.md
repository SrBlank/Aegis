# Aegis
Aegis is an IoT (internet of things) ecosytem that runs on your local network. While cloud computing is at its peak, Aegis does the opposite and runs devices accessible only on your local network. All servers and the database are hosted locally on a computer (such as a raspberry pi) and devices communicate to the server on your local network, no cloud outside internet connection required.

This is a project I have been thinking about doing for a while as it gives me a chance to explore tools and technologies in an ever expanding way. In each project folder you will find in-depth documentation from prototyping to production.
